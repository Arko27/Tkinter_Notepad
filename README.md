This is a simple Notespad made by me using Python Tkinter. Here i have used different widgets of tkinter module like labels, entry, menubar,scroll bar ad their respective attributes.
This GUI is capable of creating a new file, saving the file in ".txt" extension (by default) in the desired folder. It can also open an already saved file.
It is also capable of the basic editing features like cut, copy and paste.
The messagebox library is also imported to show a message.
